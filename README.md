# ü¶ï dinoTracker

**dinoTracker** is a full-stack savings and expense tracking app. Users can sign up, manage multiple savings plans, track expenses, and securely delete their accounts and data.

Built for speed during a hackathon, but designed with full functionality and secure user/data handling.

Originally the project was a hackathon challenge but we could not meet up to deadline so I came back months later to "fix it".
